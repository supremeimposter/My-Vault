- Never sit in a narrow seat that is small for your butt, especially cycle seat because that squeezes the nerves to the penis located in the butt.
- Exercise, but don't overdo and have proper diet.
- Keep breathing through your nose.
- Keep thinking about the positive outcomes of some work. This is very very important.
