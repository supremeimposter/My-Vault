## Warm Ups

> [!question] Why warm ups are necessary?

Warm ups are necessary to get our bodies used to more oxygen need our body is gonna demand when we start the intense workout.

Normally, you would need less oxygen, but for an intense task, you need more oxygen and body cannot quickly catch up, so body does anaerobic respiration, breaking glucose to get energy to supplement the lack of oxygen. Breaking down glucose also produces latic acid, which causes pain at the start of intense workout without a warmup.

Anaerobic respiration occurs when oxygen is in short is absent or on short supply
