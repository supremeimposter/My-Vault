# Threads

- In certain situations, a single application may be required to perform several similar tasks.
- Threads are about concurrency and parallelism.
- Head, data, code, files are shared among the threads, whereas stack and registers are NOT shared. [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1762418/what-resources-are-shared-between-threads)

## Types of Threads

- User level and Kernel level threads are initiated using some libraries.

### User Level Threads
- User level threads cannot take help from the kernel scheduler to schedule the threads.

### Kernel Level Threads
- In kernel level threads, multiple threads from the same process can be scheduled on multiple CPUs simultaneously.
