# Process

- Process, informally is a program in execution.
- When the OS schedules a program for execution, then the program becomes a process.
- A process contests for resources.
- Process Control Block PCB is the context of the process.

- How to create a process?
	- Create space in the memory - `fork`
	- Load in the memory - `exec`

- For every process, some information is stored in the previliged memory, in which there is a kernel stack to push register values for context switching.
- A process cannot access the data of other process unless there is a an inter-process communication.

## Process Control Block

A Process Control Block PCB is a C structure. There can be only a finite number of processes in a computer. Every process has a PCB associated with it. 

OS maintains a doubly linked list (or any other data structure) of PCBs somewhere in the RAM. Once a process is terminated, OS removes its PCB.

To run a program, 
	1. Create a new process
	2. Load the program from hard drive onto the new process
Both operations have separate system calls.

## Fork

> [!link] 
> [Process control â€“ Harvard CS 61](https://cs61.seas.harvard.edu/site/2024/Process/#process-creation-with-fork&gsc.tab=0)

Fork creates an exact replica of the calling process. 
- `fork()` returns the pid of the child process it has created if it is a parent. Or else it returns `0` to the child.
- The order of evaluation of parent and child process depends on scheduling.
- Topological order of the dependency graph can be the order of evaluation.

> [!NOTE]
> `pid = 0` if a process is a child process
> `pid` is non-zero if a process is a parent process

printf() prints only the logical address, not the physical address.

wait() waits for the child process to finish before proceeding with subsequent statements below wait() in the parent process.

Seems like the child processes are execute in a different order.

Topological sort can be applied to write the possible execution order based on the dependency [lec-03.pdf Pg. No. 47]

> fork with loops can either be unwinded first and executed using the code itself directly.

## Exec
- `exec()` completely replaces the current process with another process.
- The new process has the same `PID` as the old process.
