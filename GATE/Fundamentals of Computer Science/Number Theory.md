- Non negative integers is a set which includes `0` i.e. $\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \dots\}$
- $a = b$ or $a = -b$ means $\mid a \mid = \mid b \mid$
- `0` is neither positive nor negative.

- Identity element does NOT exists for subtraction and division.
## Rational Numbers
- [Lesson Explainer: The Set of Rational Numbers | Nagwa](https://www.nagwa.com/en/explainers/584141491646/)
- The set of rational numbers contain `0`.
- $\mathbb{Z} \subseteq \mathbb{Q}$. The set of rational numbers contain all the integers.
- The square root of any non-perfect square number is irrational. For example, $\sqrt{ 45 }, \sqrt{ 3 }, \sqrt{ 2 }, \sqrt{ 35 }$.
- $0.6666666666\cdots$ represented as $0.\overline{6}$ is rational numbers.
- $5.5648712154862315844785321587\cdots$ is an irrational number.

## Real Numbers
- $\pm \infty \not\in \mathbb{R}$
