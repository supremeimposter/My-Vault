**July 3, 2023** Don’t worry about taking beautiful notes, but worry about taking clear and accurate notes.

**July 3, 2023** Don’t rush to take notes of whatever is the instructor saying. Listen first, understand the concept and rewind to take the notes. It saves you from hell a lot of confusions. It may save some time too.

**July 26, 2023** I just started to not copy the questions, instead note the page no of the slides and refer to it later while revising. Anyways it's not like the problems are to be memorized.

**July 27, 2023** Do not leave gaps in a lecture. Just finish a lecture at the same time. Do not have a day gap. 

**July 27, 2023** Sachin sir has mastered the art of using stylus and Sketchbook pro

**July 27, 2023** classmate’s Rs.100 notebooks are more value for money compared to its 384 pages bulk. It has more pages for the same money compared to its big brother.

**July 28, 2023** More than half of my classmates are in Bangalore. It's not at all an issue if I don’t get a hostel room, but it will be costly.

**July 30, 2023** Do not take notes on everything. Just write down whatever you feel like necessary. Solve problems on notebooks. Write the explanations in the way that you can understand. Everything else can be referred from the slides and materials given by the faculty. 

**July 31, 2023** Learn to use and switch both online and offline materials. Don’t expect everything to be in a single notebook or in a single pdf. 

**August 1, 2023** Stop listening to songs with lyrics and watching movies. They distract me a lot while listening the lectures.

**August 2, 2023** It is annoying to click the touch-pad to focus the video player when I switch back from the lecture annotated slides

**August 3, 2023** Do you research after finishing the relevant sub topic. The lectures might cover your doubts or open an intuition to think in that way.

**August 3, 2023** Whenever I take handwritten notes, I just have this notion that my handwriting is really poor. But after sometimes, if I look back, it doesn’t really look bad. It looks better.

**August 5, 2023** When it comes to Sachin sir’s lectures, 1.5x is the normal speed.

**August 7, 2023** Sachin sir says ‘cool’ too many times

**August 9, 2023** Take easy questions as easy but don’t take it for granted. Read it thoroughly. Be a problem solver rather than an exam cracker.

**August 11, 2023** Lokesh Kanagaraj has a great taste. Dark Knight OST is not distracting at all and it is good for working.

**August 17, 2023** All these 4 years me and the rest of my department have believed that when a pointer is passed to a function, then it is call be reference in C. But the thing is that is also call by value and call by reference is no longer in C.

**August 22, 2023** Appearance based insecurities are the first few dominos. They have a domino effect on every other aspects of life.

**August 25, 2023** Just utilize Sachin sir and Deepak sir, just squeeze everything out of their brains regarding GATE. It’s a great opportunity.

**August 29, 2023** Instead of worrying about what you have not completed, appreciate yourselves for what you have completed. The former is one of the pieces of the domino while the latter lets you continue without any fear or failure.

**August 31, 2023** You may not aware of an idea at the right time. That’s what life, you figure out something and keep on going. Don’t pay heed to what everyone says.

**September 21, 2023** Most of the times, I only worry about taking the perfect notes. I should only focus on the lecture rather than taking notes. 

**September 21, 2023** These notes are supposed to make only you understand, because you made all of these. Don’t have a general mindset that you are going to publish these notes to someone.

**September 21, 2023** It really enlightens me to know that my friends are doing good. It puts a smile on my face. Its really gives a feel good vibe.

**September 23, 2023** Looking at formulae written using latex is not as interesting as hand-written ones.

**September 25, 2023** I am taking notes just for the sake of taking notes. I want it to be formatted, or look better if someone looks at it. But the thing is, it doesn't matter how good my notes look.

**September 25, 2023** Deepak Poonia and Sachin Mittal are the gems. Seriously I have been wasting a lot of time doing useless things. I somehow got into the hands of the best teachers of GATE right now in my country. I am going to use this opportunity and make the best of them.

**September 26, 2023** If you see something new, don't worry about whether you should study this also. If you feel like you want to learn this, just learn this if you have time, or else just skip and come back later. Just stop worrying on seeing new added topics.

**September 26, 2023** I spend more time worrying about pending lectures rather than focusing on the current lecture or the current subject. I should just stop worrying and utilise the time. 8 hours a days is enough to complete the syllabus. Just keep on going.

**September 27, 2023** Deepak Poonia sir is a hard-worker. He gave a 2:19:47 hours introduction to Theory of Computation. That video is the love and command he has over TOC, obtained after hard work and great understanding. From now, my motivation is not to score good rank and get into IIT'S, but to obtain the knowledge which he has and provides. The introduction just inspires me to work harder.

**September 28, 2023** Always use {obsidian + pdf} to study and revise. Don't try to type everything into obsidian. Just type some important or your observations or something you have been confused and cleared about it.

**September 28, 2023** To get into IISc, first I have to read the question carefully and clearly.

**September 28, 2023** Spending some good amount of time in understanding the basics helps in understanding the complex concepts. It's not a waste of time fiddling with the basics.

**October 3, 2023** You should take minified notes in obsidian. It clearly helps. You cannot look at a PDF which has more writings about the same thing. So watch lectures for the complete day and at the end of day, take notes from the PDF. Watching lectures for a complete day creates more context and you can avoid writing notes for silly things.

**October 7, 2023** "Do not worry about silly mistakes you have done. Go and create new silly mistakes" --Deepak Poonia, 2023.

**October 10, 2023** If you think like you should take noes, just take notes and stop overthinking. As you keep on taking notes, you will develop new templates and techniques in efficient note taking. Do not think about going back to every single note to redefine your notes, do it when you are going to revise.

**October 11, 2023** Watch more related lectures and finally take notes. Meanwhile, just write the headers of a lecture. With more context and understanding, note taking in obsidian is easier. Obsidian is more powerful than pen and paper. Use it to its full potential. 

**October 11, 2023** If you don't revise in time, you will start forgetting how things turned out to be as it was. So keep on revising, so you can re-watch the videos if you don't get something until you have access to the course.

**October 15, 2023** Do NOT take notes while watching lectures. Only write the headings. Typing notes while watching lectures creates assumptions without more context.

**October 15, 2023** Keep on watching lectures continuously and take breaks like power naps. Power napping is good if you feel tired. Take a 30 minutes sleep so you can focus back. Remember you have to study a whole day, so power napping is good. It's not bad. Take some rest and keep on studying.

**October 18, 2023** I just realised that I can change the pressure settings on my stylus pen. Now with very less pressure and with no strain on my finger bones, I can write smooth. I just love writing in my xournal++ now. Royal velvet theme for obsidian is just too good. It looks good without any background image.

**October 20, 2023** "Understanding and applying the given definition is the key to the top rank"--Deepak Poonia 2023

**October 21, 2023** Sometimes you may feel like you are NOT getting something even after watching the lectures for long and repeatedly. Just keep on going to the next lectures. Both Sachin and Deepak will give you enough context so you can understand it on may be the 4th or 5th lecture on the topic. They do make a lot of videos on a topic adding up to the bulk. But they get paid less for what they have promised. I think it is just worth listening to the lectures.

**October 23, 2023** Spending some more time on taking clear notes is much better than spending more time while revising. Clear flow of idea will definitely help you a lot. You won't remember everything or have the same understanding of ideas after a month or two when you come back to the same topic.

**October 30, 2023** Calculating the time I study really says a lot of things about my focus.

**November 2, 2023** Understanding the definitions really clears a lot of doubts and confusions. Think about the definitions and understand it better.

**November 5, 2023** Studying DM alongside other subjects is a good choice.

**November 7, 2023** Sometimes we just forget that the answer is always on the question paper.

**November 7, 2023** Do not worry about some person who is shallow minded to judge you. They can think about you for a minute at max.

**November 10, 2023** File formatting can be done later after finishing the notes from the PDF. Do not worry about it too much. 

**November 12, 2023** Stop trying to template or generalize everything you learn. You are not writing a book that is to be published. You are constructing your knowledge base that you can understand. 

**November 17, 2023** Deepak Sir is a Movie-buff.

**November 21, 2023** "When you see someone making great progress, don't assume that they are outstanding students, their works are standing out. Don't convince yourself that you are enough. Put their hard word and evaluate yourself" - Deepak Poonia.

**November 24, 2023** Spend time on the basics, build the context with better understanding. It is worth the time.

**November 30, 2023** Respecting a teacher is different from blindly following him/her. 

**January 3, 2024** You are not writing a book. You did not do any post-doc. Just make clear notes that you can understand well. Do not worry about making a digital garden. You have a lot of things to worry about.

**February 16, 2024** "Don't blindly believe or stick to one resource, even if it is GO classes. You won't grow" - Deepak Poonia.

**February 17, 2024** I am really grateful for the free extension on the validity of the course in GO classes.

**March 9, 2024** Stop compensating and start working for the sake of yourself. You cannot impress someone who wants you to be in a worst state forever. Take care of those things that are in your sphere of influence.

**March 17, 2024** "Can you make a memory chip with 3 bits in a cell? Yes, maybe you are a psycho." --Deepak Poonia, COA-24.

**April 16, 2024** I am not worthy of anything. Nobody believes me. I am just a forever loser. Never forget this day, this word. You are nothing. You are no better than anything. You do not deserve a life. You are a waste. Don't ever think anything good of yourself. It is just a delusion. You are a living corpse....According to this society and your family.

**April 30, 2024** Remove that AIR 1 idea from your thoughts. It will create unnecessary panics for every silly mistakes or some major mistakes you do while practicing. You gain mastery eventually, even after many tries, definitely not during the second try. Just keep on learning and grinding. Rank is secondary, knowledge and practice is primary. 

**May 3, 2024** Prepare yourself to be very active with your peak energy between 9am to 12pm and 2pm to 5pm. Because thats when you are probably going to write your exam next year.

**June 18, 2024** When I have spent much time on a topic, it doesn't mean I can just skim a question from a question from that topic. I have to read each and every word of the question and think about it. Given enough time to practice questions.

**July 9, 2024** Proper revision of every previous topic enhances the understanding of the upcoming topics and saves a lot of time from confusion.

**July 17, 2024** I am going to experiment a different study technique now. First I will go through the annotated notes and study the topic, followed by taking notes of the same topic by going through the same annotated notes, which is also the second revision. During the second revision, I will come to know which topic to avoid and which topic to follow.

**July 20, 2024** I will also start going interleaving of subjects to further challenge my brain. It forgets and tries to remember the information.

**August 9, 2024** When Deepak sir says, "watch movies after GATE exam", you take that seriously.

**August 11, 2024** From now on , there is no note-taking. Seriously. Its tiresome. I am going to solve a lot of problems and take the screenshots. Thats it. For every thing, I will go back to the annotated slides and note down the page number. I cannot do this anymore. Note-taking is tiring. I will waste a lot of time and I may not find time for enough practice. Its better to just look at annotated notes.

**August 12, 2024** Taking notes during the 2nd revision kind of works, but still it takes a lot of time and I am not 100% sure which to leave and which to take. Better I revise straight from the pdfs from now on. It seems like it will be better than taking notes. I cannot waste this 2nd attempt taking redundant notes. Whatever notes I am taking, it is redundant. Maybe I will use topper notes for short notes and keep revising. By avoiding taking notes, I save a ton of time which I can use in practicing pyqs and doing test series.

**September 10, 2024** Don't have the notion that you can remember all the results and observations. Keep in mind that you may have to work things out on the spot, because there are a lot of facts you have to keep in mind, and if you try to keep those observations and results of a every topic in mind, you will confuse and will lose time. Better solve anything and prepare in such a way that you will derive certain things at the exam hall.
