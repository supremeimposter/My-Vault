The reply "the result of the toss is head iff I am telling the truth" is just a propositional expression which has a truth value depending on the person that is saying.

If T1 says it, then its truth value is true.
If T2 says it, then its truth value is false.

It can be rewritten as an argument,
$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
p \Leftrightarrow q \\
\therefore p \rightarrow \overline{q}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$
It can be proved that this is an invalid argument.

A proposition can never have multiple values, it can be either true or false.

Here the given proposition is not tautology or contradiction, it cannot be said whether it is true or false, so it cannot be determined.

The question is about which one is not a tautology. 
All the options can be solved using by-case method. 

In case of **implication** (option A, B, C), then it can be solved using validity of arguments.
If the argument is valid, then it is a tautology i.e. it can never be false i.e. $T \to F$ never occurs.
The LHS can be considered as premises and the RHS can be considered as consequences.
