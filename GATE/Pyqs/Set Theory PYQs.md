Union of $n$ sets is **infinite** iff at least one of them is infinite.

Finite union of finite sets is **finite**.

For any set $\mid \mathcal{P}(S) \mid\;\; \gt\;\; \mid S \mid$ according to [[Cantor's Theorem]].

For any simple sets (sets which contains only simple elements, not sets as members) its powerset and the powerset of its powerset has empty set as a common element.
