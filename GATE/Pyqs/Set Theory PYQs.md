Union of $n$ sets is **infinite** iff at least one of them is infinite.

Finite union of finite sets is **finite**.

For any set $\mid \mathcal{P}(S) \mid\;\; \gt\;\; \mid S \mid$ according to [[Cantor's Theorem]].

For any simple sets (sets which contains only simple elements, not sets as members) its powerset and the powerset of its powerset has empty set as a common element.

If there is one element which is not related to anyone including itself, then this claim is false.

If c is related to someone, then by transitivity and symmetric, it will be reflexive. Or else not reflexive.

If a relation is known to be symmetric and transitive, it may or may not be reflexive.
