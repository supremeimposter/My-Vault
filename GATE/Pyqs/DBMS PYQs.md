From a given legal instance of a relational schema, only conclude the FDs that do not hold and never confirm any FDs that hold.

An FD holds on a schema only when every legal instance satisfies the FD.

Only BCNF removes the redundancies due to FDs. 3NF still may cause redundancies due to FDs.

3NF is adequate as it always gives lossless and dependency preserving decomposition by 3NF synthesis algorithm.
BCNF does not guarantee a dependency preserving decomposition.

The queries in the LHS are valid queries and they are not asking if the queries in LHS and RHS are equivalent or not.
Given that the queries in LHS are valid, are the queries in the RHS valid or not?
