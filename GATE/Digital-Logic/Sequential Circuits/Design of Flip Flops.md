## Implementation of Edge Triggered Flip Flops

- There are many ways to implement edge triggered flip flop and Master Slave flip flops is one of them.

### Master Slave Flip Flop

- Master Slave Flip Flop is similar to Edge Triggered Flip Flop.

- The idea is to have two flip flops (one is master and the other is slave one) connected to the same clock.
- The master flip flop is positive level-triggered and the slave flip flop is negative level-triggered.

$$
\begin{split}
Q_{m} &= f\, (D, \text{ positive level of clock}) \\
Q_{s} &= f\, (Q_{m}, \text{ negative level of clock}) 
\end{split}
$$

Assume $Q_{m}$ and $Q_{s}$ are initially $1$,

Comparing the above waveform of $Q_{s}$ with the waveform $Q_{N}$ (assuming $Q_{N}$ is initially $1$) of a negative-edge triggered flip flop, it is clear that, the waveform of $Q_{s}$ behaves like it is triggered in response to the negative edge of the clock.

Similarly the positive edge-triggered master-slave D flip flop is built.
