# Complements in Number System

Complementing is a operation on base-$r$ numbers.

```

If $n$ is the number of digits in the number $N$ in base $r$, then
- Diminished Radix Complement $= (r^n - 1) - N$
- Radix Complement $= r^n - N$
$$
((r^n - 1) - N) + 1 = r^n - N
$$
$$
\text{Diminished Radix Complement} + 1 = \text{Radix Complement}
$$

Complements are used in digital computers to **simplify subtraction operation** leading to simpler, less expensive circuits and logical manipulation.

Within the available symbols in a number system, the dimished radix complement can be found by meeting the numbers at either corresponding ends.

The complement of the complement restores the number to its original value. This applies both for diminished radix and radix complement.

If the $r$'s complement of a number $N$ is $r^n - N$, then the complement of the complement is,
$$
r^n - (r^n - N) = N
$$

If the number $N$ has a radix point, then it removed temporarily and computed the complement of $N$ and the radix point is added back in the complemented number in the same relative position.
