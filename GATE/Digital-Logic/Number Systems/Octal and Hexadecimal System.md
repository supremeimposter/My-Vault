## Octal System

Base = $8$
Symbols = $\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$

Base $= 2^3 = 8$
Binary can be easily converted to octal by grouping every 3 bits from the LS position and convert them to its equivalent decimal value.

## Hexadecimal System

Base = $16$
Symbols = $\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F\}$

Hexadecimal numbers are represented by a leading 0x e.g. 0xFC39.

> [!attention] 
> Do not forget to use A, B, C, D, E, F while converting to hexadecimal numbers.

Base $= 2^4 = 16$
Binary can be easily converted to hexadecimal by grouping every 4 bits from the LS position and convert them to its equivalent decimal value.
