# Algebraic Simplification of Boolean Functions

A simplified equivalent boolean expression means smaller logical circuit with minimum number of gates i.e. reduced literal count.

# Disadvantages of Algebraic Simplification

1. The procedures are difficult to apply in a systematic manner.
2. It is difficult to tell whether the arrived expression is the minimum solution. It depends on the order in which the terms are combined or eliminated.

Some expressions which can't be further minimized using algebraic simplification can be minimized using [[Minimization using K Map|K-map]].
