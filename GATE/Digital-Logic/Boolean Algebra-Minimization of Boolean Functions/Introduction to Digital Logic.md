- We have binary system (base 2) in computers because of the hardware limitations (transistors). Computer is a binary digital system.
- When a capacitor is charged to 5V, then it holds the binary value `1`. With time, the charge starts to drop in the capacitor, so a range of volt is set to the both the states `0` and `1`.

### Boolean
Symbols used to represent two states of a digital circuit.
`0` is used to represent the OFF state of a circuit.

Boolean do not have a numerical representation.

Boolean operations are performed on the Boolean states.
`1` AND `1` = `1`

### Binary
[[Binary System|Number system]] used to represent a numerical value.
$(15)_{10}$ is represented as $(1111)_2$.

Numerical operations are performed on the numerical values of binary.
$(10)_2$ + $(01)_2$ = $(11)_2$

## Positive and Negative Logic System

Boolean Algebra has only `0` and `1`. It does not know about voltage or any other physical entity, whereas Digital circuits has high (1) and low (0) voltage signals.

$P_1$ and $P_2$ are two persons studying the boolean algebra mapped to voltage differently.

Positive logic and Negative logic systems are **dual** of each other.
