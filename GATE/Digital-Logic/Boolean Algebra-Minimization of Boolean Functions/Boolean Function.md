# Boolean Function

A boolean algebraic function can be expressed algebraically with binary variables, the logic operation symbols, paranthesis and equal sign.

For a boolean equation $f_1 = f_2$, then
$$
\begin{split}
\text{dual can be applied} &  \text{ on both the sides}, \\
f_1^d &= f_2^d \\ \\
\text{complement can be applied}& \text{ on both the sides}, \\
\overline{f_1} &= \overline{f_2}
\end{split}
$$

## Different number of  Boolean Functions over $n$ variables

> [!header] Function over 0 variable 

If there are no boolean variables in a boolean function $f_{1}$, then the $f_{1}$ can be either $f_{1} = 0$ or $f_{1} = 1$ i.e. constant boolean functions.

> [!header] Function over 1 variable 

If there is only one boolean variable in a boolean function $f_{2}$, then the function $f_{2}$ can be any of the below,
$$
\begin{split}
f_{2}\; (a) &= a \\
f_{2}\; (a) &= \overline{a} \\
f_{2}\; (a) &= 0 \\
f_{2}\; (a) &= 1 \\
\end{split}
$$
There are $2^{(2^1)} = 2^2$ different boolean functions over $1$ variable.

> [!header] Function over 2 variables 

If there are $2$ boolean variables in a boolean function $f_{3}$, then there are 16 different boolean functions.

![[Boolean Function-20240619184627058.webp]]

> [!header] Function over $n$ variables 

If there are $n$ boolean variables in a boolean function $f$, then there are $2^{(2^n)}$ different boolean functions.
Each of the $2^n$ different input combinations has only two choices for output i.e. 0 or 1.

> [!observation] 
> Constant boolean functions `0` and `1` always occur no matter how many variables are there in a boolean function.

## Relationship between Complement and Dual of Boolean Functions

> [Complement, Dual of a Boolean Function | Self Dual | Positive, Negative Logic System | Digital Logic - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qed3vHqJicM)

> [!NOTE] 
> Dual of a boolean function can easily found if the function contains only literals, NOT, AND and OR operations (no other operations). If the given function does not contain those operations, then it can be simplified to any of the standard forms.

> [!observation] 
> For any boolean function, its dual and complement only varies by the literals.

For any boolean function $f(a, b)$, where $a$ and $b$ are the inputs to the function, then
$$f^d(a, b) = \overline{f}\;(\overline{a}, \overline{b})$$
or it can put it this way,
$$\overline{f}(a, b) = f^d\;(\overline{a}, \overline{b})$$

For a function $f$, the complement $\overline{f}$ and the dual $f^d$ are functions themselves.

To find the dual of a function $F$ from a truth table (assuming the table is in standard order), reverse the order of the complement of the function $\overline{F}$ to find out the dual of the function $F^d$.

![[Boolean Function-20240527121420948.webp]]

> [!example] 
> ![[Boolean Function-20240527175758734.webp]]

For a function $F$ over $n$ variables, 
$$
f^d\;(t) = \overline{f} \;(\;(2^n - 1) - t)
$$
where $t$ is a decimal value encoded from the input combination and $0 \leq t \leq (2^n - 1)$ 

If $f(t) = 1$, then $\overline{f}\;(t) = 0$ which means $f^d\;(\;(2^n - 1) - t) = 0$.
$$
\begin{split}
f(t) = \overline{ f^d\;( (2^n - 1) - t ) }
\end{split}
$$

> ![[Boolean Function-20240527193041878.webp]]
> 
> ![[Boolean Function-20240527194819374.webp]]

Functions which has the literal count of 1 such as $f(a) = a$, dual is same as the function.
$$
\begin{split}
f(a) &= a  \\ 
f^d(a) & = a \\
\therefore f(a) &= f^d(a)
\end{split}
$$

It is never possible for a boolean function to be equal to its complement i.e. $f \not= \overline{f}$ 

There are some functions $f$ for which $\overline{f} = f^d$.

> [!example] 
> 1. $f = 0$
> 2. $f = 1$
> 3. $f = a \oplus b$

## Special Types of Boolean Functions
> [!pdf] lec-07 Pg. no. 151

### Neutral Boolean Function

A boolean function over $n$ variables is neutral iff $f = 0$ for half of the input combinations and $f = 1$ for the remaining half of the input combinations.

For a boolean function of $n$ variables, number of neutral boolean functions = ${{2^n}_{C}}_{2^{(n-1)}}$.
Out of $2^n$ rows of input combinations, select the half $(2^{n-1})$ which gives $1$ as the output, the rest will give $0$ as the output.

![[Boolean Function-20240527204754316.webp]]

### Self Dual Boolean Function

A boolean function $f$ is a self dual function iff $f = f^d$.

![[Boolean Function-20240527210411425.webp]]
![[Boolean Function-20240527210423613.webp]]
![[Boolean Function-20240527210440917.webp]]
![[Boolean Function-20240527211143763.webp]]

In a self dual function $f$, 
$$
f(x) \not= f(\;(2^n - 1)\; - x); \: \forall x \text{ where } 0 \leq x \lt 2^n
$$
Or you can put it this way,
$$
f(x) =  \overline{f\:(\;(2^n - 1)\; - x)}; \: \forall x \text{ where } 0 \leq x \lt 2^n
$$

- One half of the outputs are not equal to the other half of the outputs for the $2^n$ input combinations i.e. half of the outputs are 1s and the other half are 0s.
- Every self dual function is neutral, but the converse is **NOT** true.

![[Boolean Function-20240527211221849.webp]]

> [!header] Number of Self dual functions for $n$ variables

![[Boolean Function-20240527211823499.webp]]

Number of self dual functions on $n$-variables $= 2^{(2^{(n-1)})}$, because each row in the first half of the standard truth table has 2 choices, whereas the lower half of the truth table has only one choice i.e. there is no choice for lower half.

### Functions whose Complement is same as Dual

> [!attention] These functions do not have a standard name.

- These functions are palindrome functions.
- These functions are **NOT** neutral boolean functions.

> [!header] Number of such functions over $n$ variables

![[Boolean Function-20240528132747882.webp]]
![[Boolean Function-20240528132801810.webp]]

![[Boolean Function-20240528132844185.webp]]
![[Boolean Function-20240528132853541.webp]]

![[Boolean Function-20240528133016871.webp]]

In this type of function $f$, 
$$
f(x) = f(\;(2^n - 1)\; - x); \: \forall x \text{ where } 0 \leq x \lt 2^n
$$
In this type of function palindrome function $f$, 
$$
f(a_{1}, a_{2}, \cdots , a_{n}) = f(\overline{a_{1}}, \overline{a_{2}}, \cdots , \overline{a_{n}})
$$

Over $n$ variables, there are $2^{(2^{(n-1)})}$ such functions.

> [!NOTE] 
> Number of $n$ length palindrome bit strings are $2^{(2^{n-1})}$

### EXOR and EXNOR functions
> [!pdf] Lec-08

> [!youtube] 
> [ExOr, ExNor functions | Odd function, Even function | Boolean Algebra | Digital Logic | GO Classes - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-30dUjh6Qv4)

![[Boolean Function-20240528135127175.webp]]

**ExOR** operation is commutative and associative and distributive.

![[Boolean Function-20240528135705213.webp]]

**ExNOR** operation is also Equivalence operation or coincidence operation.

![[Boolean Function-20240528135452108.webp]]

![[Boolean Function-20240528135427396.webp]]

**ExNOR** operation is commutative and associative.

![[Boolean Function-20240528135947841.webp]]

A chain of **ExOR** operations can be done in any order since ExOR is commutative and associative.
- ExOR is 1 iff if there are odd number of 1s (number of 0s does not matter)
- ExNOR is 1 iff if there are even number of 0s (number of 1s does not matter)

ExOR is equal to ExNOR when there are **odd** number of inputs
- $a \oplus b \oplus c = 1$ iff there are odd number of 1s
- If there are odd number of 1s in odd number of inputs, then there are even number of 0s, which means $a ⊙ b ⊙ c = 1$
- In this case $a \oplus b \oplus c = a ⊙ b ⊙ c$
$$
a_{1} \oplus a_{2} \oplus \cdots  \oplus a_{2n - 1} = a_{1} ⊙ a_{2} ⊙ \cdots ⊙ a_{2n - 1}
$$
ExOR and ExNOR are complement of each other when there are **even** number of inputs
- $a ⊙ b ⊙ c ⊙ d = 1$ iff there are even number of 0s
- If there are even number of 0s in even number of inputs, then there are even number of 1s, which means $a \oplus b \oplus c \oplus d = 0$
- In this case $a ⊙ b ⊙ c ⊙ d = \overline{a \oplus b \oplus c \oplus d}$
$$
a_{1} \oplus a_{2} \oplus \cdots  \oplus a_{2n} = \overline{a_{1} ⊙ a_{2} ⊙ \cdots ⊙ a_{2n}}
$$

> [!discussion] 
>> In standard definitions, only 2 (even) inputs are used, so XOR and XNOR are complements of each other.

Boolean functions can be minimized to its equivalent boolean expressions, which corresponds to reduced literal count and minimal number of logic gates.
