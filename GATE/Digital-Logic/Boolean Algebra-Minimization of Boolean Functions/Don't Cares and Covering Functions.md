# Don't Cares

- For a boolean function or a digital circuit, some input combinations **can never occur**. For such input combinations, we do not care about the function values.
- For a boolean function or a digital circuit, some input combinations **can occur, but we do not care** about what happens for input combinations.

- By default, boolean functions are completely specified i.e. total functions.
- Functions with don't care combinations are incompletely specified functions or partial functions.

- Since each don't care is either 0 or 1, a partial function with $k$ don't cares corresponds to a class of $2^k$ functions.
- Every partial function is a class of functions.

## Don't Cares in K-Map

- Dont cares can be used in any way we desire (0 or 1). 
- Out of $2^k$ different class of functions, there can be some minimized SOP or minimized POS expressions for the given partial function.
- We should pick the interpretation that allows for the most simplification.

# Covering Functions

- A function $f$ covers a function $g$ with the same input variables **iff** whenever $g = 1$, then $f = 1$ **or** whenever $f = 0$, then $g = 0$.
$$
f \text{ covers } g \equiv g \text{ implies } f \equiv g \rightarrow f \equiv g \subseteq f
$$
- There is no assignment of values to the variables that makes $g = 1$ and $f = 0$
- If $f$ covers $g$, then the true minterms of $g$ is a subset of true minterms of $f$.

- If $f$ covers $g$, then $f$ is the covering function of $g$ and either of these two conditions occur

## Analysis of Covering Functions

If $f$ covers $g$ and $g$ covers $f$, then $f$ and $g$ are the same functions i.e. $f = g$ 

![[Don't Cares and Covering Functions-20240621143757229.webp]]

In the below cases, consider the scenario $G$ covers $F$,

**Case 1**
If $F(a, b, c) = \sum_{m} (0, 5, 7)$, then the covering function of $F$ is,
$G = \sum_{m}(0, 5, 7) + d (1,2,3,4,6)$
The is because whenever $F = 1$, $G = 1$ and don't care about the remaining.

**Case 2**
If $F(a, b, c) = \prod_{m} (0, 5, 7)$, then the covering function of $F$ is,
Since $F = \sum_{m} (1, 2, 3, 4, 6)$, then $G = \sum_{m}(1,2,3,4,6) + d (0, 5, 7)$
This is because whenever $F = 1$, $G = 1$ and for the remaining inputs we don't care.

From understanding the above two cases,

> For any function $F$, the minimum SOP expression for the covering function of $F$ is 1

For example, $F(a, b, c) = \sum_{m} (0, 1, 2)$ and $G$ is the covering function of $F$.
$$
\therefore F \rightarrow G
$$
Whenever $F = 1$, $G = 1$.
$$
\begin{split}
G (a, b, c) &= \sum (0, 1, 2) \\
&= \sum (0, 1, 2) + d (3, 4, 5, 6, 7) \\ 
&= \sum (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) \\ 
&= 1
\end{split}
$$

> For any function $F$, the minimum POS expression for the covering function of $F$ is 1.

Since 1 is itself a POS expression, hence it is the minimum POS expression for the covering function of $F$.

Smaller product terms cover larger product terms i.e. bigger product terms implies its subset product terms.

If $P_1$ and $P_2$ are two product terms, then $P_1 \rightarrow P_2$ iff literals ($P_2$) $\subseteq$ literals ($P_1$)

![[Don't Cares and Covering Functions-20240621144627037.webp]]

Bigger sum terms cover smaller sum terms i.e. smaller sum terms implies its superset sum terms.

If $S_1$ and $S_2$ are two sum terms, then $S_1 \rightarrow S_2$ iff literals ($S_1$) $\subseteq$ literals ($S_2$)
