# Relations

- Relation is also called as Binary relation as a relation is mostly from one set to another set.

![[Pasted image 20231011100505.png]]

- Relations is a **set** containing ordered pairs of elements from sets $A$ and $B$.
- Every relation is a set, but NOT every set is a relation.
> [!important] Relation is NOT a cross product, but contains ordered pairs based on a condition. 
> Only [[Equivalence Relation#Universal Relation on $A$ is Equivalent|universal relation]] is a cross product.

- Relationship between two sets is always ONLY one way.
![[Pasted image 20231010195509.png]]
$$
R = \{\;(a, b)\; | \; a \text{ condition } b \}
$$
- The condition is how the relationship is defined between the elements of the two sets. $R$ is the binary relation between two sets $A$ and $B$. Set $A$ is called Domain and set $B$ is called Co-Domain.
$$
R : A \rightarrow B
$$
- $x \; R \; y$ iff $x$ takes $y$ i.e. $x$ is related to $y$.
- If $x$ is related to $y$, it does NOT mean that $y$ is related to $x$.
- $(a, b) \in R \equiv a \; R \; y$  . $R$ is a relation on $A$ and $B$.
- $(a, b) \not\in R \equiv a \; \not{R} \; y$  . $R$ is NOT a relation on $A$ and $B$.
> [!caution] Attention
> Avoid the sentence **x and y are related** or **x and y are related to each other** because they do NOT make any sense.

$$R \subseteq A \times B$$
> [!intuition] 
> Every subset of $A \times B$ is  a relation from $A$ to $B$.
> Every relation from $A$ to $B$ is a subset of $A \times B$.
> A is related to B under relation R.

## No of relations possible
$$
|A \times B| = |A| \cdot |B|
$$
- Number of subsets of $A \times B$ = number of relations from $A$ to $B$.
$$
\text{No of subsets of } A \times B = 2^{|A \times B|}
$$

## Relations on a Set

- Relation $R$ is on set $A$ is a relation from $A$ to $A$.
- A relation on a set $A$ is a subset of $A \times A$.
$$R \text{ is on set } A \equiv R : A \rightarrow A \equiv R \subseteq A \times A$$

> [!remember] The term "**Base set**" is used only when relation is on a single set. 
> $A$ is the base set of the above relation $R$.
> Base set is NEVER EMPTY unless explicitly specified.

### Universal and Empty relation
- $A \times A$ is the universal relation on the set $A$. It is the set of all the relations on $A$.
- There can also be an empty relation on $A$ where there is no relationship between any of the elements of the set $A$.

> [!example] $A = \{1, 2\}$

```
```col-md

![[Pasted image 20231011100933.png|Empty relation on $A$]]

### No of relations on a set $A$

> [!example] ![[Pasted image 20231010204357.png]]
> ![[Pasted image 20231010204420.png]]
- For a set $A$, where $|A| = n$, no of relations from $A$ to $A =$ no of subsets of $|A \times A| = 2^{n^{2}}$
- There are several special [[Types of Relations on a Set]] $A$.

### Identifying base set

- Identifying the base set is the important step in identifying relations on a set.

```col-md

**1. $R$ on set $A$**
> $R : A \rightarrow A$ 
> $R \subseteq A \times A$
> $aRb$
> $(a, b) \in R$
```
```col-md
flexGrow=1
===
**2. $R$ on set $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{Z}$**
> $R : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{Z}$
> $R \subseteq (\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{Z}) \times (\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{Z})$
> $(a, b)R(c, d)$
> $(\; (a, b), (c, d) \;) \in R$
```

#### Empty Base set

![[Quantifiers#What an empty domain does?]]

> [!discussion] Empty base set
> ![[Pasted image 20231011121224.png]]

- When base set is empty, a relation CANNOT be defined. For an $\phi$ base set, the relation is $\phi$
- On a base set, the relation is,
	- Reflexive and Ir-reflexive
	- Symmetric, Anti-symmetric and Asymmetric
	- Transitive
- All the definitions of the above relations involve universal quantifiers.

## Representation of Relations

### Set representation
- Write down the complete set $R$ with all the elements that satisfies the relationship condition.

> [!example] ![[Pasted image 20231010203432.png]]
> The set representation of relation from A to B is,
> ![[Pasted image 20231010203450.png]]

### Arrow Diagram representation
- Draw two boxes as sets and fill them with corresponding elements and map the relation using arrows in the diagram.

> [!example] ![[Pasted image 20231010203249.png]]
> ![[Pasted image 20231010203932.png]]

### Matrix Representation
- Draw a matrix with the elements of the set $A$ as the rows and columns.
- Tick marks when the relationship condition satisfies.
- Read the table as **row element is related to column element** and do NOT read the converse.

> [!example] ![[Pasted image 20231010204001.png]]
> ![[Pasted image 20231010204015.png]]

### Graph Representation
- Consider all the elements of the set $A$ as nodes and draw the arrows as per relationship condition.

> [!example] ![[Pasted image 20231010210437.png]]
> ![[Pasted image 20231010210418.png]]

### Representing relations on a set
- Both Graph and Matrix representation are specially available for relationship on a single set $A$. i.e $R$ on $A$.
$$
R : A \rightarrow A
$$

#### Method 1 : Matrix representation
- Example 1

#### Method 2 : Graph representation
