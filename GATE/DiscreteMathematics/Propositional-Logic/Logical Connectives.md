- These logical connectives avoid the ambiguity that the natural languages pose.
- When a logical connective is used, the propositions are not longer variables, they are propositional expression.

1. [[Negation]]
2. [[AND (Conjunction)]]
3. [[OR (Disjunction)]]
4. [[EX-OR]]
5. [[Implication]]
6. [[Bi-Implication]]
7. [[NAND]]
8. [[NOR]]

## Priority of Logical Connectives

> $\sim$ < $\wedge$ < $\vee$ < $\rightarrow$ < $\leftrightarrow$ 

- For remaining connectives, proper paranthesization must be given in the question.
- The associativity of implication is author dependent, so the paranthesis must be given in case of multiple implications.

- P -> Q -> R can be interpreted as either (P -> Q) -> R or P -> (Q -> R).

### Examples

1. Suppose P and Q are both statements.
	P: "Jack passed Math"
	Q: "Jill passed Math"
	$\neg$(P$\wedge$Q)$\rightarrow$ Q : "If at least one of them fail, then Jill pass math."
