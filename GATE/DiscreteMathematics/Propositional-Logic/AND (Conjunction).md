- All of these English words translate to conjunction (and) in propositional logic
	1. and
	2. even though
	3. yet
	4. moreover
	5. however
	6. whereas
	7. while
	8. nevertheless
	9. nonetheless
	10. though 
	11. although
	12. but
	13. still
	14. comma (,)
	But all of these words are not the same in the English language

$$
P \wedge Q
$$
The above proposition is equivalent to
	1. P and Q
	2. P is true and Q is true
	3. P but Q
	4. P yet Q
	5. P still Q
	6. P however Q
	7. P, Q
	8. Although P, Q
	9. P though Q
	10. P nonetheless Q
	11. P moreover Q
	12. P nevertheless Q

- Neither P nor Q $\equiv$ P is false and Q is false $\equiv \neg P \wedge \neg Q$
