- All of these English words translate to conjunction (and) in propositional logic
	1. and
	2. even though
	3. yet

	5. however
	6. whereas
	7. while
	8. nevertheless
	9. nonetheless

$$
P \wedge Q
$$
The above proposition is equivalent to
	1. P and Q
	2. P is true and Q is true
	3. P but Q
	4. P yet Q
	5. P still Q
	6. P however Q
	7. P, Q
	8. Although P, Q
	9. P though Q
	10. P nonetheless Q
	11. P moreover Q
	12. P nevertheless Q

- Neither P nor Q $\equiv$ P is false and Q is false $\equiv \neg P \wedge \neg Q$
