```ad-abstract
Necessary and sufficient are dual of each other.
```

$$
P\rightarrow Q
$$
- P is sufficient (enough) for Q to be true.
	- **Claim: If you are India's PM, then you are an Indian.**
	- For you to be an Indian, it is sufficient for you to be India's PM, but it is not necessary for you to be PM, you can also be a commoner.
- Q is necessary for P to be true.


$$
Q \rightarrow P
$$
- Q is sufficient for P.
- P is necessary for Q.

## Sufficient 

![[Pasted image 20230909094056.png]]
- Happening of P is enough for the happening of Q.
- P guarantees Q.
- If P is true, then Q must be true, for the claim to be true.
- Without Q being true, P cannot be true i.e. Q is necessary for P.

## Necessary 

![[Pasted image 20230909094221.png]]
- P is a necessary condition for Q which means P does not guarantee Q.
- If P is not true, then Q is also not true.

```ad-note
There are also instances where a condition is **neither necessary nor sufficient** for another condition.
```

### Examples of Necessary vs Sufficient
![[Pasted image 20230909095918.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230910080228.png]]
- If x is a natural number, then x is an integer
	- For x being an integer, it is enough for x to be an integer, but not necessary.
	- But for x being a natural number, it is necessary for x to be an integer.
	- which means P : "x is a natural number", Q : "x is an integer" i.e. P $\rightarrow$ Q

```ad-summary
Sufficient is for forward implication.
Necessary is for backward implication.

Example: 
Air is necessary for human life, but Air is alone not enough (not sufficient) for human lfe. It needs water, atmosphere, environment, etc...
