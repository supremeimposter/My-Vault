# Discrete Mathematics
- Study of discrete objects
- Example : integers, humans, eggs, etc...

## Discrete Math vs Continuous Math

- Objects studied in Continuous Math : real numbers (vary smoothly) e.g. calculus, etc...  
- Objects studied in Discrete Math : integers, graphs, and statements in logic (do not vary smoothly) e.g. probability, set theory, etc.

## Mathematical Logic

- Logic for mathematicians and computers.
- Natural Languages are ambiguous, but computers should have ambiguity
- Logic is the basis for mathematical reasoning and automated systems.

### Applications of Mathematical Logic

1. Mathematical logic is to avoid ambiguity in statements and expressions in computers.
2. To find new information from the existing knowledge.
