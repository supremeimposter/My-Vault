# Introduction to Linear Algebra

- LA is a tool to work with matrices which help the machines in understanding the data.

- Scalar – a number with magnitude 
- Vector – a number with magnitude and dimension

> [!NOTE]
> Scalar $\times$ Scalar = Scalar
> Vector $\times$ Vector = Vector
> Scalar $\times$ Vector = Vector (Vector gets scaled)

## Matrix Multiplication

a. Matrix multiplied by a vector is again a vector.
$$
\text {Matrix} \times \text{Vector} = \text{Vector}
$$

When a matrix is hit by a vector, it is either transformed into a new vector or the vector gets scaled.

b. Matrix multiplied by a matrix is a matrix.
$$
\text {Matrix} \times \text{Matrix} = \text{Matrix}
$$

If the dot product of two matrices $A$ and $B$ is a zero matrix, then it does not mean that $A$ or $B$ is a zero matrix.

The dot product of two column vectors $a$ and $b$ can be written as, 
$$
a . b = a^T . b
$$
