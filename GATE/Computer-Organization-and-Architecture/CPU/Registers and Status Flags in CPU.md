# Registers in CPU

- A [[Registers|register]] is a storage device inside the CPU. Registers are the storage elements inside CPU.

```dot
digraph G {
	label = "Classification of Registers\n";
	labelloc = "t";

	head [label = "Register", shape="box", style="filled", color="lightgreen"];
	node1 [label = "Based on the\ninformation they store"];
	node2 [label = "Based on the\ntasks assigned to them"];
	node3 [label = "Data\nRegisters", shape=box]
	node4 [label = "Address\nRegisters", shape=box]
	node5 [label = "General\nPurpose\nRegisters", shape=box]
	node6 [label = "Special\nPurpose\nRegisters", shape=box]

	head -> node1;
	head -> node2;

	subgraph cluster1 {
		label = "";
		node1 -> node3 [arrowhead=none];
		node1 -> node4 [arrowhead=none];
	}
	subgraph cluster2 {
		label = "";
		node2 -> node5 [arrowhead=none];
		node2 -> node6 [arrowhead=none];
	}
}
```


**Program Counter PC**
- Program Counter PC is a register and also a [[Counters|counter]] in the CPU, that stores the address of the next instruction to be fetched for execution.
- PC is connected to the internal address bus.
- PC is also called as Instruction Address Register or Instruction Pointer Register.

**Instruction Register IR**
- Once instruction is fetched from main memory, it is stored in Instruction Register IR.

**Stack Pointer SP**

**Accumulator AC**

**Flag Register**


- Flag register is also called as,
	1. Status Register
	2. Program Status Register PSR
	3. Program Status Word PSW
	4. Status Word

# Status Flags 

- Status flags reflect the result of an instruction executed by the processor.
- ALU simply performs the operation and updates the flag based on the result of the operation.

## Zero Flag
- Zero flag is set to 1 whenever the output of the ALU is 0.

## Negative Flag (Sign Flag)
- Sign flag is set to 1 if the MS bit of the result is 1.

## Carry Flag
- Carry flag is set to 1 when there is a carry from the adder.

## Auxiliary Carry Flag
- Auxiliary carry flag is set to 1 if there is a carry from the first nibble (from the first 4 bits) regardless of the operand size.

## Parity Flag
- Parity flag is set to 1 if the lowest byte has even number of 1s.

## Overflow Flag
- Overflow flag is set to 1 if there is an [[Overflow of Signed and Unsigned Numbers|overflow]].
