# CPU

![[Registers and Status Flags-20240723143716653.webp]]

The CPU contains,
- a lot of registers, some of which fall on the address side and some of which fall on the data side,
- an arithmetic and logic unit ALU and control unit CU,
- connections to [[Main Memory and Addressability|memory]] through uni-directional address lines and bi-directional data lines,
- an internal bus within the processor which connects different components such as ALU, CU, GPRs, IR, MAR, MBR and other registers.

![[Registers and Status Flags in CPU-20240730125731040.webp]]

The registers, ALU and the interconnecting bus are collectively referred to as the **datapath**.

Arithmetic unit performs operations such as addition, subtraction, increment, decrement, negation.
Logic unit performs operations such as AND, OR, NOT, XOR, numberical checks.

# Registers in CPU

A [[Registers|register]] is a storage device inside the CPU. Registers are the memory elements inside CPU.

Data registers store data or instruction, whereas address registers store addresses.

GPRs can be used for any purpose, but whereas SPR has predetermined functionality.

## Special Purpose Registers

To store address,ï»¿
1. Memory Address Register (MAR) 
2. I/O Address Register (I/O AR) 
3. Program Counter (PC) 
4. Stack Control Register

To store data or instructions,
1. Memory Buffer Register (MBR) 
2. I/O Buffer Register (I/O BR)
3. Instruction Register (IR)
4. Accumulator Register (AC)
5. Flag Register/Program Status Word

### Memory Address Register MAR

Memory Address Register MAR is used to store the *address* generated by the CPU to acccess main memory. It is connected to the address bus of the system bus through address decoder.

### Memory Buffer Register MBR

Memory Buffer Register MBR or Memory Data Register MDR stores the information that is being sent to, or received from the memory along the bi-directional data bus. MBR stores *data or instruction*.

### Program Counter PC

- Program Counter PC is a register and also a [[Counters|counter]] in the CPU connected to the internal address bus of the CPU, that stores the address of the next instruction to be fetched for [[Instruction Execution Cycle|execution]].
- PC is also called as Instruction Address Register or Instruction Pointer Register.
- PC is connected to the main memory via MAR.
- PC does not depend on ALU's to increment to the next address. Program Counter increments by the size of an instruction $I$ regardless of the addressing of the memory.
$$
\text{PC} \leftarrow PC + I 
$$

### Instruction Register IR

Once data is read from memory, it first goes to MBR and if the data is an instruction, then it moves to Instruction Register. 

IR holds the *current instruction* that we are executing or about to execute.

### Stack Pointer SP

Stack Pointer SP is connected to the internal address bus and holds the *address of the top of the stack* of the process in main memory during program execution.

### Accumulator AC

Accumulator AC register is associated to ALU. AC is connected to memory via MBR. 
AC stores the data that is being worked on by ALU i.e. the result of computation of ALU, or one of the operands of the ALU.

### Flag Register

Flag register is also associated to ALU. Status register sets flags to the result computed by ALU for the control unit. 

ALU does not anything about the data (signed, unsigned, positive, negative, binary or BCD) it is operating, it simply performs the operations as per the instruction and updates the [[#Status Flags|flags]]. It is upto the control unit CU to interpret the results of ALU with the help of flag register.

Flag register is also called as,
1. Status Register SR
2. Program Status Register PSR
3. Program Status Word PSW
4. Status Word SW

Six Status flags monitor the result of ALU.

# Status Flags 

Status flags reflect the result of an instruction executed by the processor. Status register stores *status bits* which are also called as condition-code or flag bits.

## Zero Flag
Zero flag is set to 1 whenever the output of the ALU is 0 or else reset to 0.
It is represented as ZF or Z.

## Negative Flag (Sign Flag)
Sign flag is set to 1 if the MS bit of the result is 1.
It is represented as NF or SF.

## Carry Flag
- Carry flag is set to 1 when there is a carry from the adder.

## Auxiliary Carry Flag
- Auxiliary carry flag is set to 1 if there is a carry from the first nibble (from the first 4 bits) regardless of the operand size.

## Parity Flag
- Parity flag is set to 1 if the lowest byte has even number of 1s.

## Overflow Flag
- Overflow flag is set to 1 if there is an [[Overflow of Signed and Unsigned Numbers|overflow]] i.e. set to 1 if the exclusive-OR of the last two carries is equal to 1.


# Instructions affecting Flags

Once a flag is set, it remains the same until another instruction that affects the flags is executed.

Data transfer instructions do not affect any flags.
