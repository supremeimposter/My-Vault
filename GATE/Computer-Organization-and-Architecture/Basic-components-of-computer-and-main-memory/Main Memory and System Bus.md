# Main Memory

- Main memory is equally divided into small units called **cells**.
- Each cell is uniquely identified by a binary number called **address**. Each address is an unsigned binary integer.
- Memory chip is also called as memory module or memory bank.
- The standard representation of main memory is,
$$
\text{Number of cells} \times \text{size of each cell (in bits)}
$$
- The capacity of the cell is decided when manufacturing the hardware.
- If there are $k$ cells (or locations or addresses) in the main memory, then minimum $\log_{2}\,k$ bits are required to uniquely identify each cell (or location or address).

- A program (instructions and associated data) must be stored in main memory.
- Addresses are not stored physically anywhere in the main memory.

- A group of $n$-bits is called a **word**, where $n$ is the word length. 
- Word Length is a property of the CPU.

| Byte Addressable                        | Word Addressable                        |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| cell size = 8 bits                      | cell size = word length of CPU          |

| data is stored byte by byte             | data is stored word by word             |

- Address of a multi-byte object is the lowest address of all bytes it contains.

- CPU does not care whether the memory is byte or word-addressable. If a CPU is a 32-bit processor (word length is 32 bits), then it expects 32 bits of data in a single fetch.

> [!NOTE] 
> Memory is byte-addressable by default and it is the best design.

- k-bit addressing means k bits are needed for specifying address of locations.


## Byte Ordering

- When the memory is byte-addressable and multi-byte primitive data is stored, then byte ordering (Endian-ness) comes into play.
- Endian-ness is a property of CPU (system). The data is ordered according to endian-ness only in the main memory.

> [!convention] 
> Big Endian - Start with the bigger end (higher byte)
> Small Endian - Start with the smaller end (lower byte)

> 
> The most significant byte of the data is the bigger end of the data.
> 
> The least significant byte of the data is the smaller end of the data.

- In Byte ordering, the data is ordered by **byte** and not by bits. There is no endian-ness in 1-byte characters. They are stored as it is.

- In Big-Endian architecture, the most significant byte of the data is at the lowest memory address and the least significant byte of the data is at the highest memory address.
- In Little-Endian architecture, the least significant byte of the data is at the lowest memory address and the most significant byte of the data is at the highest memory address.

- Endian-ness property applies only to <mark class="hltr-red">multi-byte primitive</mark> data items. 
- Endian-ness does not apply to strings, arrays or structs.
- Endian-ness cannot change the order of an array. It only the changes the order of the multi-byte primitive data which are the elements inside the array.

> [!question] When does Endian-ness matter to a programmer?
> 1. When you store a data as integer and read it later as a character, then endian-ness causes issue.
> 2. When you transfer data over bit-serial line, on transferring a single byte data, which one goes first, most significant bit or least significant bit.
> 3. When you share data and files between different computers, it can result in mis-interpretation.

# System Bus

- Memory Address Register **MAR** is used to store the address generated by the CPU to access (read or write) the memory. MAR is connected to the address lines of the system bus via a **address [[Decoder|decoder]]**.

![[Main Memory and System Bus-20240720143403509.webp]]

- Memory Buffer Register **MBR** is connected to the data lines of the system bus. It contains the value to be stored in memory or the last value read from the memory. 

- The system bus is a transmission media between different components of a computer.
- The system bus is classified into three types based on the type of information they carry.

![[System Bus-20240720122551531.webp]]

- On each line, only one bit travels at a time.

````

- Address lines are unidirectional, since they are connected from MAR to other components
- Data lines are bi-direcitonal, since CPU reads data from memory and writes into memory.
- Control lines carry the control signals that manage the transfer of data to/from CPU. They also specify the timing and direction of the data transfer.
