## Guidelines to Programming with C

## Guidelines to Digital Logic

- Some questions on boolean algebra can be solved by evaluating the boolean expressions in the options.
- If there is a doubt in a boolan equation or if you feel like you are confusing a known boolean law, just use by case method and verify.
- Use by-case method to veify large boolean equations.
- Its easier to find the complement of a large boolean expression from its dual rather than applying de-morgans's law.
$$
\overline{f} (a, b, c, d) = f^d (\overline{a}, \overline{b}, \overline{c}, \overline{d})
$$

- When truth table is given, it is easier to find dual of a boolean expression using the complement.

- Find Canonical SOP first and it will be easier to find Canonical POS i.e. $f = \sum m (f = 1) = \prod M (f = 0)$.
- To visualize a function in a k-map, firstly convert the given expression to either standard or canonical SOP for better visualization.
- See if there are any redundant larger cubes after identifying all the cubes in k-maps.
- Look for the corner 1-cells and the folding 1-cells while creating cubes.


- Do not try to remember subtraction of unsigned numbers using complements. Just apply the expansion technique and find the difference.
- Sign-magnitude, 1's complement, 2's complement representation are only for signed binary numbers in digital systems. They are not operations here, they are number systems specific to signed binary numbers in digital systems. There is no 9s complement or 10s complement representation.
- The minimum number of 1's complement is found from the complement of maximum number of 1's complement in $n$ bits. It is not a weighted system unlike 2's complement.
- Most of the signed binary addition concepts are cleared by simply adding the given two numbers.
- Binary codes are any strings of 0s and 1s derived from a systematic calculation. Each element encoded has a distinct binary code.
- Binary codes for decimal digits means binary codes for each digit of a number and not for the entire number.
- Gray code is a binary code for the entire number and not for each digit.


- Shannon's expansion theorem and compact truth table go hand in hand.
- If you are stuck with MUX, just write the canonical SOP expression of the given function and try to write the compact truth table. It will give you more ideas.
- In MUX, the functions at the input data lines have no influence on the MUX itself. The control inputs influence the MUX.
- If a MUX is given and the options are to find the function realized by the MUX, just plug in the control input values and see what happens to each of the options. Use compact or standard truth table. Use k-map when a minimized expression is required.
- If the working of a given boolean function can be mimiced using a digital circuit, then the function has been realized or implemented by the digital circuit.
- A decoder can act as a DEMUX whereas a decoder can be used to implement MUX. 


- If an unknown flip flop with combinational logic is given in the question, then apply inputs into find what kind of flip flop it is.

## Guidelines to Database Management System

- When finding candidate keys, eliminate the options based on the RHS of the FDs and test out the remaining options using clousre instead of finding out all the candidate keys.
