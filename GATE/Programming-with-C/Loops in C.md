# Loops in C

## While Loop in C

![[Loops in C-20240622194341887.webp]]

- The condition is always checked before entering the body of the loop.
- Counter update statements can be placed anywhere inside the body of the loop.

![[Loops in C-20240622194743467.webp]]

- To create an infinite loop simply keep the condition of while as true.

## For Loop in C

![[Loops in C-20240622194604556.webp]]

counter_init_stmt, condition, update_counter_stmt are optional statements.
For loop constructs can mimic while loop constructs.

- Infinite loop can be created out of for loop.

- for loop can run without a loop body.

## Do-While Loop in C

- Do-while loop is guaranteed to run at least once even if the condition fails.

![[Loops in C-20240622195945591.webp]]

- The condition is evaluated after the body of the loop is executed.

- Infinite loop can be built by keeping the condition true.

## Break and Continue

`break` statement breaks out of the current loop.
`continue` statement skips the current iteration in the current loop.

- infinite loops can be stopped with `break` statements.
