# UniDirectional Shift Register



# BiDirectional Shift Register



# Universal Shift Register



# Linear Feedback Shift Register


- It is used for random number or sequence generation.
- In a LFSR of $n$ bit register, $2^n - 1$ distinct patterns are generated except all 0s pattern.
- If we start with a random number within the range of the register, we end up getting a random sequence of numbers and get back the same number after some number number of shifts.
