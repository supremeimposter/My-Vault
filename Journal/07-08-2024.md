Today's target is 4 session of 4 pomos

1 session = 4 pomo = 1hr 40 minutes
4 sessions = 16 pomos = 6 hours 40 minutes

**10:12 AM** Finished 1 pomo. Interrupted in 2nd pomo halfway through
**01:08 PM** Finished 1 session with some little distractions. But compensated during break time. On break right now.
**02:05 PM** Finished 1 pomo. interrupted in 2nd pomo halfway through.
**07:56 PM** Finished 1 session mostly with no breaks. Even took the time of the long break for doubt clarification.
**09:20 PM** Getting a lot of external distractions.
**09:39 PM** Getting back to study again. Lets do this. 6 more pomos left. There are a lot of pomos I have left either in half or with 8 to 9 minutes left. But I am not counting it. A complete pomo is a pomo.
