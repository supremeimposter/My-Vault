Today's target is 4 session of 4 pomos

1 session char= 4 pomo = 1hr 40 minutes
4 sessions = 16 pomos = 6 hours 40 minutes

**09:02 AM** Finished 1 pomo already. Today I am going to use up all the time and rock this world.

**11:30 AM** One complete session has been completed. Total 5 pomos finished so far. I am progressing.

**01:36 PM** Starting another session now. Lets rock this world. Yesterday I was at this level by midnight. But I have half of the day left. 

**04:13 PM** still 2 more sessions left. Somehow lost the time. Maybe because of naps. why do I take naps? Maybe I have to do stretches.

**08:35 PM** Still 4 more pomos left. Got insecure feelings and wasted some time on reddit.

**11:06 PM** there are only 104 days left. I cannot keep on playing anymore. I need to level up to 8 hours in a week, so I can progressively achieve 10 hours per day in this month and keep consistent at it. I need to do stretches in the morning. I cannot just sit all day. My body aches and keeps on disturbing me. I should stay away from my phone. I will try to one more pomo today. That leaves out at 2 pomos for today.
