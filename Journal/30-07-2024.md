Today's target is 4 session of 4 pomos

1 session = 4 pomo = 1hr 40 minutes
4 sessions = 16 pomos = 6 hours 40 minutes

I have wasted a lot of time. Now all I have to do is stay focused on keep on grinding at least 8 hours a day. Nothing more, but definitely nothing less.

**12:39 PM** Now I have finished only 4 pomos. I have to focus a lot and stop wasting time. I can do it. 12 more pomos to go.

**01:47 PM** so far 6 pomos done. Let me get a quick nap of 25 to 30 minutes. I feel really tired, don't know why. Still 10 pomos left. I am gonna do it.

**04:19 PM** 8 pomos finished so far, still 8 more left. I am winning. Lets do this for the next week and try to maintain it consistently without breaking it.

**07:14 PM** I have a lot of doubts in the question [CO and Architecture: GATE CSE 2005 | Question: 79](https://gateoverflow.in/1402/gate-cse-2005-question-79?show=265202). Now I am going to start COA mod-2 revision until instruction execution cycle.

Still one pomo left, Will do this tomorrow. Lets rock this world.
