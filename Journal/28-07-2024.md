Today's target is 4 session of 4 pomos

1 session = 4 pomo = 1hr 40 minutes
4 sessions = 16 pomos = 6 hours 40 minutes

I will try my best to make use of the available very limited time. But there is enough time to get clear understanding and taking clear notes.

Notes are really important for faster and smooth revision sessions which are crucial at the last 2 months. Don't think too much about taking notes.

Topper notes are available after many revisions and removing a lot of details, which they went through themselves. 

I have to create my own detailed notes and refine to a crisp version. Understanding and clarity is important than saving a lot of time and worrying during revision sessions. 

Revision sessions will be much longer if the notes are not clear, which I cannot afford. 

**:CoClock: 11:21:11** I could have checked all the pomos, but all these youtube content got my attention from evening. I should stay strong from now or else I won't be able to succeed.
