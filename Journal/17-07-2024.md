I have strategized a new plan.

First i will read the annotated notes without taking any notes and solely trying to understand the thing and practice.

Now immediately after finishing the topic, I will come back to the first page and read through again taking note of only the important things.

Right now I am on [[Set Definition]].

Lets do this until Aug 14, 2024 and see what happens.
