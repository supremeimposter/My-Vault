Will try not to distract and focus on the tasks at least for 8 hours.

Todays target is 8 hours -> Cannot achieve it.

Tried one 25 minute pomodoro session - it felt really long and enough time.
Maybe my attention span is short. But will make use of it.

From tomorrow, it is only strictly pomodoro sessions only.
