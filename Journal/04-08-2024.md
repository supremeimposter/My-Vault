Today's target is 4 session of 4 pomos

1 session = 4 pomo = 1hr 40 minutes
4 sessions = 16 pomos = 6 hours 40 minutes

**09:17 AM** started the study session

**12:12 PM** Finished 4 pomos so far. A lot of gap in between each pomos. Will do this better after lunch.

**01:56 PM** Feeling sleepy now. Will do a problem and take a little nap and then will continue.

**03:33 PM** Couldn't take the nap because of noise. Finished 1 pomo now.

**05:22 PM** 8 pomos have been finished so far. Still 8 more to go. In this week, 16 pomos has to be normalized.

**06:22 PM** One session finished now. But felt like I was not focusing and time went by. Because it has been so long I have watched a video lecture and I have to work my attention span for listening to someone. 6 more pomos left. I am definitely doing this today. Checking all the boxes.
