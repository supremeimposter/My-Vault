Got my first bluetooth headphones.
Linux is not good for bluetooth devices.

But fortunately, Zebronics Duke has AUX support. Initially it was not good, but by evening it is perfect at around 50% volume. Sounds good in aux and I don't have to turn on the headphones anymore. No more worries about battery and the never-ending bluetooth fix on linux.
