Today's target is 4 session of 4 pomos

1 session = 4 pomo = 1hr 40 minutes
4 sessions = 16 pomos = 6 hours 40 minutes

**01:55 PM** Starting OS. Will finish OS in 9 days. That's it. 
**06:57 PM** Finished 1 complete session of 3 pomos after a long time. Now its break time. But I don't feel like taking a break.
**11:10 PM** Finished 1 complete session of 4 pomos. Its a great feel. Should I take this break or should I proceed to study? 8 pomos finished today. But a lot of pomos have been distracted. Around 7 hours focused today.
