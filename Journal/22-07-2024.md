Today I am trying the pomodoro app, since ora pm does not have inbuilt pomodoro feature.

Gnome pomodoro has a flaw, when the on-screen notification of break pops up, it never closes, when the next pomo starts, when the screen notifications is turned on.

When the screen notification is turned off, then there is no indication of a break or for next pomo.

Now switched to Pomatez app. Its better than gnome pomodoro.
