I have been trying to optimize my time schedule.

Note taking may seem like a waste of time while taking notes, but during revision, it helps a lot.

Toppers took notes and studied hard by managing time efficiently throughout their preparation. Thats why their notes became topper notes.

Mine is a note so far, I have to make it a toppers note by becoming a topper myself.

My notes deserve to be toppers note. Make it happen. 
Water breathing 10th form : Constant flux.

I think I should go for 3 pomos per session and constantly increase it to 4 pomos per session.
