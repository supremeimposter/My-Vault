# [[Set Definition|Sets]] $\{a, b, \dots\}$

- Order does not matter.
- Repetition does not matter.
- Sets can be finite or infinite.

---
# Ordered N-tuple $(a, b, \ldots, n)$

- Sequence of more than two elements surrounded by parenthesis.
- n-tuples are finite.

## Equality of n-tuple

> [!question] When $(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots a_n) = (b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots b_n)$ ?
> iff $\forall_{i} \; a = b_i$


## Ordered Pairs $(a, b)$

- Mathematical structure containing sequence of two elements surrounded by parenthesis.
- Order and repetition of the elements matters.
- Ordered Pair can also be called as 2-tuple.

- Examples : $(x, y)$ co-ordinate system

### Equality of Ordered Pairs

> [!question] When $(a, b)$ is equal to $(c, d)$ ?
> iff $a = c$ and $b = d$

> [!question] When $(a, b)$ is equal to $(b, a)$ ?
> iff $a = b$

# Sequences $<a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots>$

- Order matters and Repetition of element matter.
- Sequences can be of finite or infinite elements.
- Sequence is enclosed between $<>$ .

- $1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots$
- $a, b, c, d, e, f, \ldots$
