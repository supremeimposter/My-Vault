## Identity Elements for Set Operations

| Operation            | Identity Element    |
|:---------------------|:--------------------|
| Union                | $\phi$              |
| Intersection         | Universal Set M     |
| Set Difference       | No identity element |
| Symmetric Difference | $\phi$              |
| Cross Product        | No identity element |  

- Only $\cup$ and $\cap$ are idempotent.

> [!NOTE] Complementation law and Complement laws are different.

- Commutative
	1. Union
	2. Intersection
	3. Symmetric Difference

- Associative
	1. Union
	2. Intersection
	3. Symmetric Difference

- Absorption law can be interpreted quickly using venn diagram. It is only for $\cup$ and $\cap$ .
- De-Morgan's law of complement is for $\cup$,  $\cap$ and complements of sets only.

- Domination Law
	- $A \cup M = M$, $M$ is the dominator for the operation $\cup$.
	- $A \cap \phi = \phi$, $\phi$ is the dominator for the operation $\cap$.
